## About CQRS - Command Query Responsibility Segregation

According with [Martin Folwer](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) 
> At its heart is the notion that you can use a different model to update information than the model you use to read information. 
> For some situations, this separation can be valuable, but beware that for most systems CQRS adds risky complexity.

The user can also request the balance of it's account. Down here you can see the design:
